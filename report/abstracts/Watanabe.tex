Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a programming paradigm where a system is described using declarative abstractions of the change propagation of discrete events and continuous signals. Distributed-XFRP is a pure FRP language that facilitates a uniform description of distributed coordination and per-node computation. The runtime system of the language based on the Actor model guarantees that the propagation of values is single-source glitch-free. Namely, it ensures the temporal consistency for each source value. Also, two fault-tolerant mechanisms let a system work appropriately on unreliable networks where the out-of-order delivery or message loss may occur. Some case studies, including a sensor-actor network, show that the language is suitable for programming coordination behaviors.
