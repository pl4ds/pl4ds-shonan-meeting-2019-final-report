The Links programming language pioneered the tierless/multi-tier/cross-tier paradigm of distributed (web) programming, allowing client, server, and database code to be written in a single uniform language.

Since the first paper about Links in 2006, much effort has gone into the development of the language, leading to many new features and changes. In this talk, I will give an overview of ``modern Links'', and describe the active projects currently extending the language.

As a concrete example, I will discuss recent work bringing distributed session-typed channels to the web setting, and how session-typed channels can be used to reimplement code which previously used RPC.
