Building trustworthy and highly available cloud applications is inherently complex and error-prone. Current industrial solutions are either ad-hoc solutions, relying heavily on the developerâ€™s expertise, or use protocols that blindly restrict concurrency reducing performance and availability. We have proposed sound techniques that either reduce or avoid coordinating the execution of operations, while enforcing the correctness of the application. To minimise coordination based on application specific invariants, an analysis technique was developed that identifies which operations would be unsafe under concurrent execution. The developer can then devise and formally check an optimized coordination protocol that guarantees the application invariants. Alternatively, coordination can be eschew altogether by extending operations with repair actions that ensure application invariants are always maintained. The modified operations preserve the original semantics when no conflicting updates occur. If a concurrent conflict occurs, we leverage conflict resolution policies to ensure a deterministic result that preserves the application invariants.
