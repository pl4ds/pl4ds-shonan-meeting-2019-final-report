FreeST is an experimental concurrent programming language. Based on a core linear functional programming language, it features primitives to fork new threads, and for channel creation and communication. A powerful type system of context-free session types governs the interaction on channels. The compiler builds on a novel algorithm for deciding type equivalence of context-free session types. This talk provides a gentle introduction to the language and discusses the validation process and runtime system. [Joint work with Andreia Mordido, Bernardo Almeida, Peter Thiemann]
