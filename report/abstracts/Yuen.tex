Yampa is a domain-specific language of the Haskell programming
language for hybrid systems, where its behaviour is continuous and
discrete.  A Yampa program executes continuous behaviour in a discrete
runtime environment by sampling.  If sampling should miss a critical
point in switching continuous behaviour, the Yampa program may result
in an unexpected error, although the program is correct in the
continuous semantics.  Since samplings are uncertain in the runtime,
correctness of a Yampa program depends on the runtime.  We describe
the discrete behaviour of Yampa programs explicitly triggered by the
sampling signal.  We translate a subclass of Yampa programs to
transition systems composed with automata generating sampling triggers
with jitter. Then, we check the behavioural properties of Yampa
programs under explicit sampling by the Uppaal model checker.
