This talk introduces our project Ikra, a data-parallel extension to Ruby for GPGPUs, and discuss its underlying implementations in relation to distributed programming.  The goal of the project is to enable easy-to-write programming experiences into GPGPU, whose state-of-the-art programming style represent all data in the problem domain by using arrays of primitive data in C. Among the design and implementation issues in Ikra, this talk highlighted its support for object-oriented programming, in particular its low-level memory layout optimized for efficient GPGPU computation and dynamic object allocation, which was not virtually possible before.   The talk also presented a catalog of applications, including direct and Barns-Hut n-body simulations, an agent-based traffic simulation, and population dynamic simulations.  They demonstrate the expressiveness of object-oriented support as well as the performance improvement based on the low-level optimization techniques.
