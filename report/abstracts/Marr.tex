Event-loop-based applications have a surprisingly high number of concurrency bugs. While they are rising in popularity with JavaScript, Akka, or other systems, debugging tools that support developers have not kept up. As a consequence, concurrency issues in event loop systems are very time consuming to track down issues. One reason is the inherent non-determinism. Another is that we rarely debug at the level of the chosen concurrency model, but at the level of threads and method calls.

In our work, we developed efficient deterministic record \& replay and snapshotting approaches that allows us to analyze and debug a problem as often as we need to, to be able to fix a bug. Combined with our Kompos debugger, as presented in the demo session, these approaches give developers better tools to explore and understand complex concurrent interactions. Instead of debugging the implementation level, in Kompos we can reason about messages, event-loop turns, and promises, which reduces the semantic gap between programs and debugger.

We focused our work on the high-level support for concurrency models such as the actor model, but the underlying techniques are agnostic. With our work on performance, we hope that they are also practical enough to make their way into industrial systems.
