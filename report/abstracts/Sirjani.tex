In the era of Cyber-Physical systems and Internet of Things, software system developers have to deal with increasing complexity of huge and heterogeneous systems. Building distributed, asynchronous, and event-based systems is a complicated task. Moreover, because of the dynamic and evolving nature of autonomous systems, a key challenge is providing runtime quality assurance techniques - in form of verification and performance analysis – that can react to changes in a timely manner. Software needs to react to the uncertainty and possible changes in the system and environment. A family of actor-based languages are introduced to enable model driven development and provide a natural and usable model for building distributed, asynchronous, and event-based systems with least effort. To provide dependability in the context of a model-driven approach, model checking and simulation tools are built based on the formal semantics of the language. I will show how these models can be used in safety assurance and performance evaluation of different systems, like self-driving cars, Network on Chip architectures, sensor network applications, train scheduling, and flow management.
