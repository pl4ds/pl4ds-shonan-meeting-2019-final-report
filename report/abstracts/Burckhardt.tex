Serverless computing, often called Functions-as-a-Service, is a fast-growing paradigm that enables high productivity for cloud application developers. Functions can execute in response to external events (e.g. web requests) and can in turn call stateful services (e.g. cloud storage). In combination with a runtime that handles deployment and scale automatically, stateless functions open an appealingly simple and rapid way to cloud application development. However, for some workloads, stateless functions are inefficient and/or difficult to use. In particular, (1) excessive data movement can impact latency and throughput, (2) the possibility of failures (e.g. partial execution of functions) or any need for synchronization (e.g.  to handle conflicts and races between functions) creates significant design challenges and complexity.

To address this, Durable Functions re-introduces durable state and synchronization into the serverless programming model, by extending stateless functions with the concepts of Orchestrations, Entities, and Critical Sections. Orchestrations solve the partial execution problem by tracking the execution of a multi-step function durably. Entities provide addressable stateful abstract data types, preventing excessive data-transfer and allowing sequencing of single-object operations. Finally, critical sections allow mutual exclusion between functions, providing a straightforward, familiar means for multi-object synchronization.
